       <ul>
    
        <li><span>1908</span> - Henk (Henderikus Franciscus) Sloot is born in Frederiksoord (part of Weststellingwerf, Friesland, The Netherlands), in a small colony house. <br>In the 19th century, the 'Maatschappij van Weldadigheid' ('society of well-doing') founded a colony in this region, where unemployed people from the provinces North- and South-Holland were sent to work on the land.</li>
          <li><span>1913</span> - The Sloot family moves into a new farm, also built by the Maatschappij van Weldadigheid.</li>
          <li><span>1920</span> - Finishes primary school, works on his parents' farm</li>
           <li><span>1926</span> - Attends a 2-year agricultural course</li>
          <li><span>1928</span> - Military service in Remonte Depot in Milligen, not as a Hussar, as he had hoped, but as a Hussar horses' carer.</li>
          <li><span>1929</span> - Leaves military service and returns to his family</li>
          <li><span>1930</span> - Leaves his family's house. He doesn't want to become a farmer like his father, and seeks adventure as a polder labourer.</li>
          <li><span>1931</span> - The adventure continues: Henk moves to 'Holland' (province South-Holland) and works on several farms as a swain. </li>           
        <li><span>1939</span> - Gets mobilised because of Germany threatening to invade the Netherlands</li>
         <li><span>1940</span> - Marries Alie Gouweleeuw a couple of weeks before the German invasion. They settle down in Den Haag. </li>
          <li><span>1941</span> - Gets a job in milk factory Van Paridon in Wassenaar.  </li>
           <li><span>1958</span> - Alie dies. Henk and Alie had no children. </li>
        <li><span>1959</span> - Marries Riet Wijsman. They move to Zoetermeer and get two daughers, Marian and Corine. <br>Every day, he goes to his work in Wassenaar on his racing bicycle, no matter what weather it is.</li>
        <li><span>1974</span> - Retires. At that point he has acquired a chief's position in the factory where he started out 33 years ago. For a couple of years, he continues working; a part-time job in a lab equipment factory in Zoetermeer.</li>
        <li><span>1976</span> - Starts writing about his life. </li>
            <li><span>1981</span> - Finishes a book about his life in Den Haag during World War 2 ("Een uit velen").  He tries to find a publisher for his books but without success. A local newspaper publishes an article about him and his book. In the article he mentions <strong>NIOD, the Dutch Institute for War Documentation</strong>, that's willing to add his manuscript to their collection.<br>But in 2014, as it turns out, NIOD doesn't have the manuscript. They receive a copy.</li>
            <li><span>1984</span> -Finishes a book about his childhood and early youth ("De hoeve aan de heikant"). This book also doesn't get published. But a newspaper in his birth region publishes a couple of fragments from his manuscript.<br>
He continues writing, this time about his years as a young adult.</li>
        <li><span>1985</span> - His health deteriorates. Lung cancer is discovered in an early stage. He gets cured, but after that he gets a stroke, which leaves him partly paralysed. He also suffers from aphasia, and has to move to a nursing home.  </li>
          <li><span>1988</span> - Dies at the age of 79.</li>
